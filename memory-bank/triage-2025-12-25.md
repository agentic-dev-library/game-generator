## CI/Workflow Status

### Failing Workflows
- **Rust CI**: Multiple runs failing on PR branches
- **Ollama PR Orchestrator**: Consistent failures (parse errors)
- **Auto Merge**: Skipped (dependencies failing)

### Root Causes
1. Build artifacts (target/) committed to PRs causing massive diffs
2. Formatting issues (Rust 2024 edition changes)
3. Missing .gitignore entries for target/
4. Possible compilation errors in recent commits

## Critical Path to 1.0 Stable

### Phase 1: Fix Infrastructure (CRITICAL)
1. ✅ **Add target/ to .gitignore** - Prevent build artifacts in PRs
2. ⚠️ **Fix CI failures** - All workflows must pass
3. ⚠️ **Clean up PR diffs** - Remove build artifacts from all PRs

### Phase 2: Merge Feature PRs (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Proposed Merge Sequence:**
1. **PR #36** (DALL-E) - FIRST (currently MERGEABLE, just needs verification)
2. **PR #37** (Voice) - SECOND (needs conflict resolution with main + #36)
3. **PR #38** (Dead code) - THIRD (needs conflict resolution with main + #36 + #37)
4. **PR #42** (Management) - LAST (needs undraft + review)

**Rationale**: PR #36 is mergeable and provides critical image generation. PR #37 adds voice (independent feature). PR #38 cleans up code (touches many files). PR #42 is management/meta.

### Phase 3: Issue Cleanup (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Close #15 (DALL-E) after PR #36 merges
2. Close #18 (Voice) after PR #37 merges
3. Close #20 (Dead code) after PR #38 merges
4. Close or document #12 (CI) after all workflows pass

### Phase 4: Documentation (REQUIRED FOR 1.0)
1. Verify all docs follow jbcom branding (docs/jbcom-rustdoc.css)
2. Generate rustdoc with custom CSS
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages with proper theme
4. Update README with 1.0 features

### Phase 5: Dependencies & Security (REQUIRED FOR 1.0)
1. Run `cargo audit` to check for vulnerabilities
2. Update dependencies per issue #10
3. Pin critical dependencies

### Phase 6: Release (FINAL)
1. Create 1.0.0 release tag
2. Generate changelog from conventional commits
3. Publish crates to crates.io (if applicable)
4. Publish docs to GitHub Pages
5. Create GitHub release with artifacts

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (TODAY)
1. Add `target/` to .gitignore
2. Clean all PRs to remove build artifacts
3. Fix conflicts in PRs #37 and #38
4. Run local CI checks on all PR branches
5. Verify source changes exist in PRs (not just artifacts)

### Short-term Actions (THIS WEEK)
1. Merge PRs in proposed sequence
2. Close corresponding issues
3. Fix remaining CI failures
4. Update dependencies
5. Run security audit

### Medium-term Actions (POST-1.0)
1. Address issue #19 (smart provider selection)
2. Consider issue #21 (repository split) - architectural decision
3. Plan issue #23 (new rust-agentic-game-development repo)
4. Implement issue #25 (PyO3 bindings) - Python integration

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- ❌ **Build artifacts in PRs**: Causing massive diffs, review issues, conflicts
- ❌ **CI failures**: Blocking merges, unclear what's broken
- ❌ **Missing source changes**: PRs showing only build artifacts, not actual code

### Medium Risk Items
- ⚠️ **Merge conflicts**: PRs #37 and #38 need conflict resolution
- ⚠️ **API key security**: ElevenLabs key storage pattern
- ⚠️ **Dependency versions**: May have security vulnerabilities

### Low Risk Items
- ✓ **Documentation**: Clear guidelines exist
- ✓ **Feature completeness**: Core features implemented
- ✓ **Code quality**: Reviews are generally positive

## Success Criteria for 1.0

- [ ] All 4 PRs merged successfully
- [ ] All CI/CD workflows passing (green checks)
- [ ] Issues #15, #18, #20 closed (addressed by merged PRs)
- [ ] Issue #12 (CI failures) resolved
- [ ] No compiler warnings (`RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings`)
- [ ] No clippy warnings
- [ ] All code formatted (`cargo fmt --check`)
- [ ] Documentation generated with jbcom branding
- [ ] GitHub Pages deployed with proper theme
- [ ] Dependencies audited and updated
- [ ] 1.0.0 release tag created
- [ ] Changelog generated
- [ ] GitHub release published

## Next Steps

1. Fix .gitignore to prevent future build artifact commits
2. Clean up all PR branches to remove target/ directories
3. Resolve conflicts in PRs #37 and #38
4. Run comprehensive local testing on each PR
5. Merge PRs in sequence: #36 → #37 → #38 → #42
6. Close issues as corresponding PRs merge
7. Generate and deploy documentation
8. Create 1.0.0 release
