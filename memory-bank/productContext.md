**📋 Supplemental Documentation**: User experience analysis and product strategy details are available in `supplemental/` directory. See `supplemental.md` for comprehensive product development studies.

## Why This Product Exists

The AI RPG Generator exists to democratize RPG game creation. Currently, creating even a simple RPG requires:
- Significant programming knowledge
- Artistic skills for asset creation
- Months of development time
- Understanding of game design principles

This generator removes these barriers by using AI to handle all technical and creative aspects automatically.

## The Problem It Solves

### For Developers
- Eliminates months of boilerplate coding
- Provides professional-quality assets automatically
- Handles complex systems like combat, inventory, dialog
- Generates contextually appropriate content

### For Non-Programmers
- Makes game creation accessible to everyone
- Visual configuration wizard instead of coding
- Automatic generation of all technical aspects
- Professional results without technical knowledge

### For Educators
- Teaching tool for game design concepts
- Students can focus on design, not implementation
- Rapid prototyping for game design courses
- Demonstrates AI applications in creative fields

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow
1. **Launch the generator** - Simple command line or executable
2. **Configuration Wizard** - Visual pygame interface for game setup
3. **Asset Generation** - Automatic creation of all visual/audio assets
4. **Code Generation** - Safe, real-time code creation with preview
5. **Play the Game** - Fully functional RPG ready to play

### Key Features
- **Semantic Asset Analysis**: AI analyzes 1000+ RPG icons and intelligently categorizes them
