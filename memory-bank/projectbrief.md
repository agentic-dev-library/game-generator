# AI RPG Generator Project Brief

**📋 Supplemental Documentation**: Complete project analysis, architectural studies, and implementation strategies are documented in `supplemental/` directory. See `supplemental.md` for comprehensive technical documentation.

## Project Purpose
The AI RPG Generator is a complete system that transforms the tedious process of RPG game development from "months of coding" into "minutes of configuration." It combines semantic asset analysis, intelligent asset generation, safe real-time code generation, and a complete game engine to produce fully functional pygame-based RPG games.

## Core Problem Being Solved
Traditional RPG development requires:
- Months of coding and asset creation
- Manual sprite design and coloring
- Tedious game system implementation
- Complex audio and dialog creation

This project automates all of these through AI-powered generation.

## Target Audience
- Indie game developers who want to prototype RPGs quickly
- Hobbyists who want to create games without extensive coding
- Educators teaching game development concepts
- Studios needing rapid RPG prototyping

## Success Criteria
- Generate a complete, playable RPG in under 5 minutes
- Produced games are actually fun and professional-looking
- All generated code is safe and secure
- Assets are contextually appropriate and visually cohesive
- System is extensible and modular

## Technical Constraints
- Must use pygame for game engine (Python-based)
- Must ensure code generation safety (no arbitrary code execution)
- Should work offline after initial AI model setup
- Must produce standalone games that can be distributed

## Scope
- IN SCOPE: RPG game generation, asset creation, dialog, audio, complete game systems
- OUT OF SCOPE: 3D games, multiplayer, mobile deployment (initially)
